# audioanalysis_c-
my openframeworks project to make an audio-analysis tool in openframeworks to extract audiodata for visualisations

to use this project with code, open up an empty openframeworks project and simply replace the src folder with my src folder and you project should be up and running:)
only thing you will need to is in the audioplayer.cpp read about how to add your own audio files
